# 🧑‍💻 VIM Code Editor

Vim is  a “modal” text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. 


## 💳 What is modal? 

When you’re using most word processors and text editors, the alphanumeric keys (i.e., a through z, 1 through 9) are only used to input those characters unless they’re modified by a control key. In Vim, the mode that the editor is in determines whether the alphanumeric keys will input those characters or move the cursor through the document.


## 📖 The Basics of Moving in Vim

- h  ⇒ moves the cursor one character to the left.
- j  ⇒ moves the cursor down one line.
- k  ⇒ moves the cursor up one line.
- l (L)  ⇒ moves the cursor one character to the right.
- 0  ⇒ moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
- $  ⇒ moves the cursor to the end of the line.
- w ⇒ move forward one word.
- b ⇒ move backward one word.
- G ⇒ move to the end of the file.
- gg ⇒ move to the beginning of the file.
- `.  ⇒  move to the last edit.


## 📝 Editing Vim Style

- d ⇒ starts the delete operation.
- dd ⇒ One line delete or cut
- dw ⇒ will delete a word.
- d0 ⇒ will delete to the beginning of a line.
- d$ ⇒ will delete to the end of a line.
- dgg ⇒ will delete to the beginning of the file.
- dG ⇒ will delete to the end of the file.
- u ⇒ will undo the last operation.
- Ctrl-r ⇒ will redo the last undo.


## 🔎 Searching and Replacing

- /*text* *⇒* search for *text* in the document, going forward.
- n *⇒* move the cursor to the next instance of the text from the last search. This will wrap to the beginning of the document.
- N *⇒* move the cursor to the previous instance of the text from the last search.
- ?*text ⇒* search for *text* in the document, going backwards.


## 📑 Copying and Pasting

- yy ⇒ To Copy a line
- dd ⇒ To cut a line
- p/P ⇒ Paste a line


## 📚 Saving and Quitting

- :q ⇒ Quite
- :q! ⇒ Quite and not save
- :w ⇒ Save
- :wq ⇒ Save and Quite
- :wq! ⇒ To save Read only File (If have permission)
- :x ⇒ Save and Quite {Not Recommended} 😳
